**[Rebranded] CatGPT 2.1 LLM BETA**

CatGPT 2.1 LLM BETA is an advanced, all-in-one ROM hacking kit and the sequel to Doctor 64. This cutting-edge tool utilizes generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate and modify game environments without a traditional game engine. Trained on 50,000 episodes of classic games, CatGPT 2.1 introduces new capabilities that push the boundaries of ROM hacking and game development.

## Features

- **GAN-Based Game Environment Generation:** Automatically generate game levels, characters, and environments in real-time.
- **Web Scraping for Data:** This version includes a feature that gathers data from the web and converts it into ROM hack memory through GPTBot.
- **Read-Only ROM Access:** Ensures secure and versatile use for game development and research.
- **Dynamic Response:** The AI model responds to player actions dynamically, delivering an immersive gaming experience.
- **Creative Process Acceleration:** Automatically generate new game layouts and features, speeding up the development process.
